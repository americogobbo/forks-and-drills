#summary Some concepts of real painting useful for the gimp dynamics.

= Real Painting =

In the real painting world we must work with canvas, inks, brushes and others tools, normally the group of these things is named 'media'. Many times a media can be used in different ways and each artist develops a particular style and use of this things, for instance, Francis Bacon, used often the old clothes to stain their paintings.
I think useful to talk about this because is very common to think that a specific tool can be used only a specific painting technique.
An artist can be use a sumie brush to paint with another material as oil or acrylic, sure isn't unusual but is possible... and his work will be not a sumie technique. In the same way is possible that an artist would do a sumie style work using a hard bristle brush. Then the tools, materials, don't say anything about the techniques can be possible of them.
