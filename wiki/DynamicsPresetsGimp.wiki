== Introduction ==
The new Gimp 2.8 is becoming a tool very powerful for the painting, mainly with the new Dynamics feature. But this feature is very difficult to use if you don't have an idea precise or a great picture of the new context of Gimp.
Is important now to use this feature understanding what are truly the new dynamics and a new concept of preset. Before the two things were mixed now they are separated.
In this document I'll do an excursus about this ... I'll try find a new way to understand brushes and presets, painting media and dynamics ...
