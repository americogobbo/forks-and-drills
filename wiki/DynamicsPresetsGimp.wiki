#Some annotations for the gimp 2.8
= Introduction =
I think that the new Gimp 2.8 is very powerful mainly to painting, with the new Dynamics feature. But this feature is very difficult to use if you don't have an idea precise or a great picture of the new context of Gimp.
Is important now to use this feature understand truly what is the dynamics and what is a preset. Before these two things were mixed now they are separated.
