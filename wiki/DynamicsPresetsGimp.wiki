== Introduction ==
The new Gimp 2.8 is becoming a tool very powerful for the painting, mainly with the new Dynamics feature. But this feature is very difficult to use if you don't have an idea precise or a great picture of the new context of Gimp.
Is important now to use this feature understanding what are truly the new dynamics and a new concept of preset. Before the two things were mixed now they are separated.
In this document I'll do an excursus about this ... I'll try find a new way to understand brushes and presets, painting media and dynamics ...

== Themes ==
  * Real _Painting_, _Media_ and _Tools_. [RealPainting]
  * Media and tools for the _digital painting_. [DigitalPainting]
  * _Dynamics_ and _behaviors_ for the digital painting. [DynamicsBehaviors]
  * What are and not the _Dynamics_ and _Presets_ on Gimp 2.8.
  * How we can to explore better the new possibilities and _simplify_ the _workflow_.
  * How to cohabit the system of the brushes (vbr, gbr, gih) with the new features (dynamics and presets).
  * Which the things that need _improvements_ to don't cause the _mistakes_ and to have a better and clear workflow.
