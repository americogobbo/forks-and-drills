Main note:
The series is supposed to simulate traditional painting and graphics techniques such as woodcut, litography, red chalk, drypoint, ink drawing . The brushes are designed for painting using a mouse. For the woodcut brushes, no dynamics are used. For red chalk brushes, we recommend changing the intensity using a combination of Air brush tool and the Flow function, for Round Brush, we recommend using a table and the Size dynamics.
