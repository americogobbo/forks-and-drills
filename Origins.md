#History and sources of my Brushes for Gimp
The archives tar.gz *2008-09.tar.gz*; *2011.tar.gz*; *z-studies.tar.gz* and *origin.tar.gz* are all previous works and studies to design the current series of forks-and-drills sets. Many of brushes are the preliminary studies and some are also present in the current set of GIMP 2.8.14, Krita 2.9 and the old GPS of Ramon Miranda.

**License and authoring**

All brushes, source docs and others are of my authoring. All stuff is licensed by GPL 3.0.
